"""
Deterministic Decision Engine for SavVio.

Rule-based labeling system that assigns GREEN / YELLOW / RED to
(user, product) pairs. This engine is AUTHORITATIVE — neither the
ML model nor the LLM wrapper may override its output.

The engine answers: "Should this user buy this product?"

    GREEN  — Purchase fits comfortably within the user's financial life.
    YELLOW — Genuine concern — the user should pause and think.
    RED    — Purchase would cause financial harm.

Design principle:
    Every rule combines signals from at least TWO independent correlation
    groups to avoid false triggers from a single underlying cause.

Correlation groups:
    Group 1 — Income capacity:   affordability_score, discretionary_income,
                                  price_to_income_ratio
    Group 2 — Savings depth:     saving_to_income_ratio, savings_to_price_ratio,
                                  emergency_fund_months, residual_utility_score
    Group 3 — Debt burden:       debt_to_income_ratio, monthly_expense_burden_ratio
    Group 4 — Independent:       credit_risk_indicator, net_worth_indicator

Features used — 11 total (5 DB + 6 computed), ALL financial:
    DB:       discretionary_income, debt_to_income_ratio, saving_to_income_ratio,
              monthly_expense_burden_ratio, emergency_fund_months
    Computed: affordability_score, price_to_income_ratio, residual_utility_score,
              savings_to_price_ratio, net_worth_indicator, credit_risk_indicator

Usage (batch — label generation for ML training):
    from deterministic_engine.financial_engine import DecisionEngine
    engine = DecisionEngine()
    df["label"] = df.apply(engine.decide_row, axis=1)

Usage (single pair — Decision API):
    result = engine.decide(financial_dict, product_dict)
